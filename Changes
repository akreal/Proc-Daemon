0.14  Fri Jun 03 2011
	- The filename memory is now a part of the object (not a package variable
	  any more). This was a bug.
	- Since <fork> is not performed on Windows OS as on Linux, I removed the
	  <eval> and <warn> from 0.13 and add an INFO to the documentation.
	- Updated the documentation.

0.13  Wed Jun 01 2011
	- Add ability to define the user identifier for the daemon if you want to
	  run it under other user then the parent (request from Holger Gläss).
	- Add <eval> and <warn> for OS not supporting POSIX::setsid (e.g. Windows).
	- Updated the documentation.

0.12  Tue Mai 24 2011
	- Init() did not close all filehandles reliably in some cases. Thanks again
	  to Rob Brown for reporting.
	- Text improvement in the documentation.

0.11  Mon Mai 23 2011
	- Init() didn't close all filehandles reliably (see also bug report at
	  http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=72526). Thanks to Rob Brown
	  for reporting and offering a patch.
	- Attributes 'dont_close_fh' AND 'dont_close_fd' added so we can define
	  file handles and descriptors that must be preserved from the parent into
	  the child (daemon).
	- Updated the documentation.
	- In some environment it is not allowed to open anonymous files. In this
	  case now a 'pid_file' must be defined. Thanks to Holger Gläss for
	  reporting.

	  behavior of process-group Signals.

0.05  Thu Okt 28 2010
	- Fixed a problem when using the old method of calling Proc::Daemon::Init
	  without object (reported by Alex Samorukov). The parent process didn't
	  exit.
	- Fixed a problem with Proc::ProcessTable 0.44: Under some conditions
	  'cmndline' retruns with space and/or other characters at the end.
	- Update and small fixes in the documentation.

0.04  Sun Okt 24 2010
	- Added functions: new(), adjust_settings(), fix_filename(), Status(),
	  Kill_Daemon(), get_pid() and get_pid_by_proc_table_attr().
	- Init() now returns the PID of the daemon.
	- Fork() now allways returns values like Perls built-in 'fork' does.
	- Description was rewritten, extended and moved to the new Daemon.pod file.
	- Additional test are done at installation.
	- $SIG{'HUP'} was set to be valid only 'local' (bug report).
